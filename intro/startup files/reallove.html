        <h1>Real Love</h1>
        <h3>The Beatles</h3>
        <hr></hr>
        <p>[Verse 1: John Lennon & John Lennon, Paul McCartney & George Harrison]
        <br>All my little plans and schemes
        <br>Lost like some forgotten dreams
        <br>Seems that all I really was doing
        <br>Is waiting for you
        </p>
            
        <p>[Verse 2: John Lennon & John Lennon, Paul McCartney & George Harrison]
        <br>Just like little girls and boys
        <br>Playing with their little toys
        <br>Seems like all we really were doing
        <br>Is waiting for love
        </p>

        <p>[Pre-Chorus: John Lennon]
        <br>No need to be alone
        <br>No need to be alone
        </p>
            
        <p>[Chorus: John Lennon]
        <br>It's real love
        <br>It's real
        <br>Yes, it's real love
        <br>It's real
        </p>
            
        <p>[Verse 3: John Lennon & John Lennon, Paul McCartney & George Harrison]
        <br>From this moment on I know
        <br>Exactly where my life will go
        <br>Seems that all I really was doing
        <br>Is waiting for love
        </p>
    
        <p>[Pre-Chorus: John Lennon]
        <br>No need to be afraid
        <br>No need to be afraid
        </p>
        
        <p>[Chorus: John Lennon, Paul McCartney & George Harrison]
        <br>It's real love
        <br>It's real
        <br>Yes, it's real love
        <br>It's real
        </p>

        <p>[Verse 4: John Lennon & John Lennon, Paul McCartney & George Harrison]
        <br>Thought I'd been in love before
        <br>But in my heart, I wanted more
        <br>Seems like all I really was doing
        <br>Is waiting for you
        </p>
        
        <p>[Pre-Chorus: John Lennon]
        <br>No need to be alone
        <br>No need to be alone
        </p>
        
        <p>[Outro: John Lennon, Paul McCartney & George Harrison]
        <br>It's real love, yes, it's real
        <br>Yes, it's real love, it's real
        <br>Yes, it's real love, it's real
        <br>It's real love, it's real
        <br>Yes, it's real love, it's real
        <br>It's real love, it's real
        <br>Yes, it's real love, it's real
        <br>It's real love, it's real
        <br>Yes, it's real love
        </p>
