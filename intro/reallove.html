        <h1>Real Love</h1>
        <h3>The Beatles</h3>
        <hr></hr>
        <p>[Verse 1: John Lennon & John Lennon, Paul McCartney & George Harrison]</p>
        <p>All my little plans and schemes</p>
        <p>Lost like some forgotten dreams</p>
        <p>Seems that all I really was doing</p>
        <p>Is waiting for you</p>
            
        <p>[Verse 2: John Lennon & John Lennon, Paul McCartney & George Harrison]</p>
        <p>Just like little girls and boys</p>
        <p>Playing with their little toys</p>
        <p>Seems like all we really were doing</p>
        <p>Is waiting for love</p>

        <p>[Pre-Chorus: John Lennon]</p>
        <p>No need to be alone</p>
        <p>No need to be alone</p>
            
        <p>[Chorus: John Lennon]</p>
        <p>It's real love</p>
        <p>It's real</p>
        <p>Yes, it's real love</p>
        <p>It's real</p>
            
        <p>[Verse 3: John Lennon & John Lennon, Paul McCartney & George Harrison]</p>
        <p>From this moment on I know</p>
        <p>Exactly where my life will go</p>
        <p>Seems that all I really was doing</p>
        <p>Is waiting for love</p>
    
        <p>[Pre-Chorus: John Lennon]</p>
        <p>No need to be afraid</p>
        <p>No need to be afraid</p>
        
        <p>[Chorus: John Lennon, Paul McCartney & George Harrison]</p>
        <p>It's real love</p>
        <p>It's real</p>
        <p>Yes, it's real love</p>
        <p>It's real</p>

        <p>[Verse 4: John Lennon & John Lennon, Paul McCartney & George Harrison]</p>
        <p>Thought I'd been in love before</p>
        <p>But in my heart, I wanted more</p>
        <p>Seems like all I really was doing</p>
        <p>Is waiting for you</p>
        
        <p>[Pre-Chorus: John Lennon]</p>
        <p>No need to be alone</p>
        <p>No need to be alone</p>
        
        <p>[Outro: John Lennon, Paul McCartney & George Harrison]</p>
        <p>It's real love, yes, it's real</p>
        <p>Yes, it's real love, it's real</p>
        <p>Yes, it's real love, it's real</p>
        <p>It's real love, it's real</p>
        <p>Yes, it's real love, it's real</p>
        <p>It's real love, it's real</p>
        <p>Yes, it's real love, it's real</p>
        <p>It's real love, it's real</p>
        <p>Yes, it's real love</p>
